# Automated-Report-Generation

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **automatically generate a formatted PDF report** from a real-world dataset using Python. It reads restaurant data from a Zomato dataset, performs meaningful data analysis, and compiles the results into a clean and readable PDF file.
The goal is to automate reporting tasks using Python's powerful data handling and PDF generation libraries. This kind of solution can be applied in analytics, business reporting, education, or any domain where structured datasets are used regularly.

# Objective
- Read and process data from a CSV file.
- Perform relevant analysis such as:
  - Calculating average cost.
  - Identifying top-rated and most-voted restaurants.
  - Analyzing top categories based on listing type.
- Generate a well-structured PDF report summarizing the insights.
- Make the process repeatable and user-friendly.

# Features
- Automated PDF report generation
- Real-time data analysis
- Smart data cleaning and preprocessing
- Clean and readable PDF formatting
- Fast and lightweight script execution
- Easily reusable with similar datasets

# PDF Report Generation
- Organized into clear sections with headings and spacing.
- Each analysis is output with consistent formatting.
- Exported the report using the `FPDF` library.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming logic.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- FPDF: For creating and formatting the PDF.

# Applications
- Automating business reporting and summaries.
- Academic assignments and data science projects.
- Weekly/monthly performance insights for dashboards.
- Real-time insights for decision-making.
